# Project Blackbox

The purpose of this program is to create a functional assembly program that executes 6 bit instructions 
loaded from a file line by line or entered in the input box built-in the program. The program executes 
the instructions (known as words) in each register until the halt instruction is reached or the all of the
registers have been executed.

The program was designed to only run .txt files other than entering instructions directly to the built-in
input box. This decision was made to assure maximum accuracy and to prevent the user from crashing the 
program by running a file type that the program wouldn't be able to read accurately.

A past version of this program was made supporting 4 bit instructions, but it was decided to change the
instruction size to 6 bits to allow for a larger register memory. The new version of the program will
be able to convert the old 4 bit instructions to 6 bit instructions. Once the instructions are converted
and successfully loaded, the program will be able to run them as if they were 6 bit instructions, and any
further alterations to the instructions will be done to the newly converted 6 bit instructions.

## A few things to keep in mind while using the program:
- You must use a halt instruction at the end of the program routine you mean to run. That will prevent
unwanted instructions from being performed. If no halt instruction is present the program will run 
every register until it reaches register 249.
- If an invalid instruction is entered an error message will be displayed showing the location of the
bad instruction, then the program will be automatically halted.
- Any empty register (+000000) will be skipped by the compiler until the end is reached.
- After you done running a program file, you will be given the option of running another one.
- Any time you open a new file all of the memory will be reset in order to load the new instructions.

## How to run the program:

You may run the program by opening the command shell in the directory containing all of the python scripts, 
then running the command bellow:

```shell
python gui_app.py
```
Once you execute the command above, a GUI will be open to the screen that can be used to execute any amount
of BasicML scripts.

You can load the instructions buy pressing the "Load Instruction" button as shown bellow or in the "File" menu on the top of the program:

![Load Instruction(Button)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callmevalente/project-blackbox/main/ReadMe%20Images/Load%20Instructions%20(Button)%20v2.png)

Once you select "Load Instructions", a new window will appear as shown bellow. In this new window you may load the instructions from a file or enter them manually buy entering all of the instructions in the text box in the window. If you decide to open a file, you will be given the change to modify the instructions before loading them to the registers by pressing "Process Entry":

Once the instructions successfully loaded, they will be displayed the table shown in the first image bellow. At this point, you may double click any of the register entry in the table to edit it. Once you double click it, the window shown in the second image bellow will appear and you may enter the new value to be stored in the register:

![Registers (Double Click)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callmevalente/project-blackbox/main/ReadMe%20Images/Edit%20Register%20v2.png)

Once the registers are loaded as desired you may execute the instructions by pressing the Run button as shown bellow:

![Run Button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callmevalente/project-blackbox/main/ReadMe%20Images/Run%20(Button)%20v2.png)

While the program is executing, a new button will appear that will allow you to abort the execution:

![Cancel Button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callmevalente/project-blackbox/main/ReadMe%20Images/Cancel%20(Button)%20v2.png)

Once the program execution is completed, you will be given the option to rerun the program by pressing the button shown bellow (Just keep in mind that the program will run with all the modifications made during the previous execution):

![Rerun Button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callmevalente/project-blackbox/main/ReadMe%20Images/Rerun%20(Button)%20v2.png)

In the top of the window you will find a "File" menu that can be used to load the instructions or save the register instructions to a txt file:

![File Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callmevalente/project-blackbox/main/ReadMe%20Images/File%20(Menu)%20v2.png)

Next to the "File" menu you will find the "Execution menu" that can be used to run/cancel/rerun program, reset all the register to 0, and clear the console:

If you wish to change the color scheme of the program, you may click on the "Change Color Scheme" under the Style menu.

Once you select the option, you will be able to choose a primary color (color of the background) as shown bellow:

![Primary Color](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callmevalente/project-blackbox/main/ReadMe%20Images/Style%20(Primary).png)

Then you will be able to choose a secondary color (color of the buttons) as shown bellow:

![Seconday Color](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callmevalente/project-blackbox/main/ReadMe%20Images/Style%20(Secondary).png)

After selecting both colors, the color scheme of the program will be modified as shown bellow:
